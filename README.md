NLPSentiment 

The purpose of this assignment was to explore using Natural Lanaguage Processing from news articles. Specifically, we are looking at news headlines from Bitcoin and Ethereum to get a better feel of public sentiment and better understand coin prices. 

I'm not sure if it's my background in Psychology but I really enjoyed working with the nltk.sentiment.vader library and I am excited to keep exploring with different sentiment analyzers.
